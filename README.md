## All DLCs unlocked up to: `v1.199 - Heavy Industry`

Space Engineers DLC unlocker

You have to replace the game files with those in the archive.
If you mess with something, a backup is included so you don't have to recheck your files from Steam.

Extract the "Content" folder in your game directory.  
Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\

To download the archive, click on the green "Code" button and then on "Download zip".  
Or download it from [MEGA.nz]()

If some minor bug patches prevents proper operation of the game, let me know in the discussion tab.  
Otherwise, I will update the unlocker with the next major release (I'm currently not playing due to summer job).

If you want to edit the files yourself, be careful because with each update, small changes are made in almost all the files,  
so it is NOT enough to edit only the last file added by the DLC.

Special thanks to user 0x000015, that made [ColorfulRainbow](https://github.com/0x000015/ColorfulRainbow), but it's no longer updated.
