- 🔄 ***If a patch breaks the unlocker***:

If on the main menù of the game you notice that DLCs has disappeared,  
it means that the latest patch replaced the "steam_api64.dll" file whit an updated one so,  
wait for a new version of this unlocker or just follow the steps below.  

(please pay attention to the difference between "steam_api64.dll" and "steam_api64_o.dll")

  - Open `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\`
  - Copy "steam_api64.dll" to the `Bin64\backup` folder, overwrithing the old one
  - Delete "steam_api64_o.dll"
  - Rename "steam_api64.dll" to "steam_api64_o.dll"
  - Open the CreamAPI archive and unzip "steam_api64.dll" into "Bin64" folder.
  - Now you must see the dlcs in the main menù.

If the game does not start or you can't see dlcs in the main menù after this,  
see the "Troubleshooting" section on how to check files from steam and wait for an update.

- ⚠️ ***Troubleshooting***:

  - If your antivirus say something, make an exception for the steam_api64.dll.  
    (it's safe, but it's like a crack and software houses don't like it when you play their games for free)

  - If you are not sure and want to restore default files via steam:
