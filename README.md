- 🕹️ ***Installation***:

  - Extract the **"Content"** folder in your game directory, replacing all files:  
*zip archive* -> **DLC Unlocker**/`Content`  
*example* -> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers/`Content`  

  - A backup is included so you don't have to check all your game files from Steam:  
*zip archive* -> **Original backup**/`Content`

- 🔄 ***For every new Major Release***:

  - DO NOT re-apply the unlocker if it hasn't been updated yet to the latest game version.
    - You can find other unlockers at the bottom of this page, in case this isn't already updated.

  - If you want to play the game before the new unlocker release, you will find new blocks locked and if there was some changes in previous dlcs files, those will appear blocked as well.
    - An example: A new dlc is released and previous Warfare dlc gets an update, the blocks you've already built still work, but you won't be able to build new ones.

      - If this way the game is unstable or buggy, you'd better check the game files from steam, then play without dlc blocks and wait for the new unlocker version.

- 📜 ***Notes***:

  - This is intended to unlock blocks of DLCs, so you can use them without paying for the DLC.

    - Unfortunately, skins cannot be unlocked the same way, as they use a different method than blocks.

  - I will update the unlocker at every major release.

  - If you want to edit dlc files yourself, be careful because with each update there are probably small changes to the previous ones, so it is NOT enough to edit only the latest dlc file.
