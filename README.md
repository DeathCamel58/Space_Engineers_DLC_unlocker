- ***Installation***:

  - Extract the **"Content"** folder in your game directory, replacing all files:  
*zip archive* -> **DLC Unlocker**/`Content`  
*example* -> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers/`Content`  

  - A backup is included so you don't have to check all your game files from Steam:  
*zip archive* -> **Original backup**/`Content`

- ***When a new Major Release comes***:

  - If you won't be playing it until the unlocker release, there's no need to worry.

  - If you want to play it, **before** downloading the update from Steam and to avoid ingame crashes/errors upon completion, you need to restore the dlc files inside the "Original backup" folder, then just update, play and wait for the new unlocker release.

    - If your game was automatically updated without restoring backups first, it's best to check the game files from Steam before playing.

- ***Notes***:

  - Skins cannot be unlocked as they use a different method.

  - If you want to edit dlc files, be careful because with each update there are probably small changes to the previous ones, so it is NOT enough to edit only the latest dlc file.

   - I will update the unlocker at every major release.
