## All DLCs unlocked up to: `v1.198 - Warfare 1`

Space Engineers DLC unlocker

You have to replace the game files with those in the archive.
If you mess with something, a backup is included so you don't have to recheck your files from Steam.

Extract the "Content" folder in your game directory.  
Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\

To download the archive, click on the green "Code" button and then on "Download zip".  
Or download it from [MEGA.nz](https://mega.nz/file/OVATzSRQ#CK0PE4lREO5panNIModG2zLOZ0TXQl-jNMd5vc-0fBg)

If some minor bug patches prevents proper operation of the game, let me know in the discussion tab.  
Otherwise, I will update the unlocker with the next major release.
