# 🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS 🚧

---
## [Space Engineers DLC Unlocker](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker#space-engineers-dlc-unlocker)

### 🛞 All DLCs unlocked up to: `v1.203` - *Warfare Evolution & Decorative Pack #3* ✔️
### 🍦 Now using CreamAPI.

### The old .sbc file method no longer works, a different modification is now required.

>[💾 NOT WORKING PLEASE WAIT - Click HERE to download](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), or click the green **`Code`** button then **`Download ZIP`**

---
- 🕹️ ***Installation***:
  - Download from above.

    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\`
  - Play.

---
- 📇 ***Files in the archive***:
  - `cream_api.ini` : the config file
  - `steam_api64.dll` : the creamapi file
  - `steam_api64_o.dll` : the original "steam_api64.dll" but renamed (creamapi NEED it)
  - `backup\steam_api64.dll` : just the original file NOT renamed, if you want to restore all to default.

[<img src="https://i.ibb.co/h7hwpbn/Empty-png.png" width="1"/>](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker#space-engineers-dlc-unlocker)

---

- 💡 ***How to restore all to default***:
  - Open `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\`
  - Delete "cream_api.ini", "steam_api64.dll" and "steam_api64_o.dll"
  - Open "backup" folder and move "steam_api64.dll" back to "Bin64" folder

---

- 🧰 ***What I did to set up CreamAPI***:
  - Downloaded CreamAPI from the [source page](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=70576)
  - Checked out the Space Engineers DLC on its [database page](https://steamdb.info/app/244850/dlc)
  - Edited the creamapi.ini file based on the game and its DLCs
  - Opened the folder:
    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\`
  - Renamed the file "steam_api64.dll" to "steam_api64_o.dll"
  - Placed here the CreamAPI files ("creamapi.ini" and the new "steam_api64.dll")
  - Started the game, all dlcs unlocked.

---

- 📜 ***Notes***:

  - This unlocker is meant to unlock DLC blocks, so you can use them without paying for DLC.

    - Unfortunately, skins and emotes cannot be unlocked.

  - I will update the unlocker when needed.

  - If you want to buy the game:
    - Space Engineers on [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
    - Space Engineers on [CDKeys.com](https://www.cdkeys.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=space%20engineers)

---

- ⚠️ ***Troubleshooting***:

  - If your antivirus say something, make an exception for the steam_api64.dll.
    (it's safe, but it's like a crack and software houses don't like it when you use their games for free)

  - If you want to play the game after a new dlc update, but before a new unlocker release:  
    <details><summary>this is what you need to know, click here to show how.</summary><p>

- 🔄 ***Important things you need to know for every new DLC release***:

- 📜 ***Notes***:

  - This unlocker is meant to unlock DLC blocks, so you can use them without paying for DLC.

    - Unfortunately, skins and emotes cannot be unlocked the same way, as they use a different method.

  - I will update the unlocker at every DLC release.

  - If you want to edit dlc files yourself, be careful because with each dlc update there are probably small changes to the previous ones, so it is NOT enough to edit only the new dlc file (and miss blocks).

  - If you want to buy the game:
    - Space Engineers on [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
    - Space Engineers on [CDKeys.com](https://www.cdkeys.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=space%20engineers)
