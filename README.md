- üïπÔ∏è ***Installation***:

  - Copy the **"Content"** folder to the game directory (confirming file replacement):  
*from zip archive* -> "DLC Unlocker/**`Content`**"  
*to game (example)* -> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\ "  

  - If needed, a backup is included (same process as above):  
*from zip archive* -> "Original backup/`Content`" -> *to game folder*

- ‚ö†Ô∏è ***Troubleshooting***:

  - If pasting the folder doesn't prompt you to replace files, you did something wrong:  
    Only the `"Content"` folder must be placed inside the game folder,  
     - the one **within** "DLC Unlocker" (to unlock dlcs) **< OR >**  
     - the one **within** "Original backup" (to restore default files).

- üîÑ ***Important things for each update that adds a new DLC***:

  - ‚õî DO NOT re-apply the unlocker if it hasn't been updated yet to the latest game version ‚ùó
    - You can find other unlockers at the bottom of this page, in case this isn't already updated.

  - If you want to play the game after a new dlc update but before the new unlocker release, you will find new blocks locked and if there was some changes in previous dlcs files, those will appear blocked as well.
    - An example: A new dlc is released and previous Warfare dlc gets an update, the blocks you've already built still work, but you won't be able to build new ones from the Warfare dlc.

  - If this way the game is unstable or buggy, you'd better check the game files from Steam, then play without dlc blocks and wait for a new unlocker version.

- üìú ***Notes***:

  - This is meant to unlock DLC blocks, so you can use them without paying for DLC.

    - Unfortunately, skins cannot be unlocked the same way, as they use a different method than blocks.

  - I will update the unlocker at every DLC release.

  - If you want to edit dlc files yourself, be careful because with each update there are probably small changes to the previous ones, so it is NOT enough to edit only the latest dlc file.
