## All DLCs unlocked up to: `Warfare 1`

As "[ColorfulRainbow](https://github.com/0x000015/ColorfulRainbow)" is no longer updated, I decided to continue its work (Special thanks to user 0x000015).

You have to replace the game files with those in the archive.
If you mess with something, a backup is included so you don't have to recheck your files from Steam.

Extract the "Content" folder in your game directory.
Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\

To download the archive, click on the green "Code" button and then on "Download zip".

I promise i will keep this unlocker updated :)
