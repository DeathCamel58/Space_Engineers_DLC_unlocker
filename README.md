- ***Installation***:

  - Extract the **"Content"** folder in your game directory, replacing all files:  
*zip archive* -> DLC Unlocker/`Content`  
*example* -> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers/`Content`  

  - If you mess with something, a backup is included so you don't have to recheck all game files from Steam:  
*zip archive* -> Original backup/`Content`

- ***When a new Major release comes***:

  - **Before** downloading the update and to avoid ingame crashes/errors upon completion, you need to restore the dlc files inside the "Original backup" folder, then just play and wait for the new unlocker release.

    - If your game was automatically updated without restoring your backups first, it's best to check the game files from Steam.

- ***Notes***:

  - Skins cannot be unlocked, as they use a different method.

  - If you want to edit dlc files, be careful because with each update there are probably small changes to the previous ones, so it is NOT enough to edit only the latest dlc file.
