## All DLCs unlocked up to: `v1.199 - Heavy Industry`

Space Engineers DLC unlocker

---

You have to replace the game files with those in the archive.
If you mess with something, a backup is included so you don't have to recheck your files from Steam.

Extract the "Content" folder in your game directory.  
Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\

To download the archive, click on the green "Code" button and then on "Download zip",  
or download it from [MEGA.nz](https://mega.nz/file/OdIBgK5B#XNFf175_yigNXa6eTokah3UjqnUjCgm7qMDQ7Ph80ss) (1.199)

I will update the unlocker with the next major release.

If you want to edit the files yourself, be careful because with each update, small changes are made in almost all the files, so it is NOT enough to edit only the last file added by the DLC.
