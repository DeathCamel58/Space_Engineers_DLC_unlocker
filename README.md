- üïπÔ∏è ***Installation***:

  - Copy the **"Content"** folder to the game directory (confirming file replacement):  
*from zip archive* -> "DLC Unlocker/**`Content`**"  
*to game (example)* -> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\ "  

  - If needed, a backup is included (same process as above):  
*from zip archive* -> "Original backup/`Content`" -> *to game folder*

- ‚ö†Ô∏è ***Troubleshooting***:

  - If pasting the folder doesn't prompt you to replace files, you did something wrong:  
    Only the `"Content"` folder must be placed inside the game folder:
    - the one **within** "DLC Unlocker" to unlock dlcs  
    - or the one **within** "Original backup" to restore default files

  - If the game hangs on "connecting" when joining a server (discussion [here](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker/discussions/17)):  
    Seems to be a conflict between some server-mod and the unlocker, you can try another server or  
    close the game and restore the backup files (included), then try to connect and play without the unlocker.  

  - It is no longer possible to paste dlc items contained in blueprints on a server (discussion [here](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker/discussions/19)):  
    Some game mechanics has been changed and sadly there is no way to fix this issue.

- üîÑ ***Important things you need to know for every new DLC release***:

  - ‚õî DO NOT ‚õî re-apply the unlocker if it hasn't been updated yet to the latest game version ‚ùó
    - You can find other unlockers at the bottom of this page, if this isn't already updated.
  - If you want to play the game after a new dlc update, but before the new unlocker release:  
     <details><summary>this is what you need to know, just click here.</summary><p>
     
     In this case, you will find new blocks locked and if there was some changes in previous dlcs files, those will appear blocked as well.  
     An example: A new dlc is released and previous Warfare dlc gets an update, the blocks you've already built still work, but you won't be able to build new ones from the Warfare dlc.  
     If this way the game is unstable or buggy, you'd better check the game files from Steam, then play without dlc blocks and wait for a new unlocker version.  

     This is how to start file checking:  

    - Directly from your browser  

      Copy/paste this link into the url bar and press Enter (even with Steam closed)  
      ```
      steam://validate/244850
      ```

    - From Steam  

      -Right click on Space Engineers, then Properties  
      -select Local Files on the left, then Verify integrity of game files.
    </p></details>

- üìú ***Notes***:

  - 1Ô∏è‚É£ This unlocker is meant to unlock DLC blocks, so you can use them without paying for DLC.

    - Unfortunately, skins and emotes cannot be unlocked the same way, as they use a different method.
  
  - 2Ô∏è‚É£ I will update the unlocker at every DLC release.

  - 3Ô∏è‚É£ If you want to edit dlc files yourself, be careful because with each dlc update there are probably small changes to the previous ones, so it is NOT enough to edit only the latest dlc file.

  - 4Ô∏è‚É£ If you want to buy the game:
    - Space Engineers on [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
    - Space Engineers on [CDKeys.com](https://www.cdkeys.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=space%20engineers)
